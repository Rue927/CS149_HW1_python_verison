Top 10 James Madison Quotes (according to brainyquote.com)
----------------------------------------------------------
[10] The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.
[9] The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted.
[8] The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.
[7] What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?
[6] The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.
[5] America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity. That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture and the arts.
[4] Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.
[3] Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.
[2] The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.
[1] If men were angels, no government would be necessary.

Your solution must NOT use the + operator. For this exercise, Autolab will reject submissions that have a "+" character anywhere in the file.
